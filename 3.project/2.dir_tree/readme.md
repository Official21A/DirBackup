# Directory Tree

This script will let you search and move between your folders and by entring "this" keyword, it will give you
an output file ( which you can set the name of if in command line ) with the tree diagram of current folder you are at.

This script is usefull cause you can just get the whole system files and directories names and places in a ".txt" file.
>> This program starts from root, so as soon as your enter "this" when the program started, you will get your full system files :)

```shell
./dirtee.sh "outputfile"
```
