# Virtual Environment Creator

The long process of creating a 'virtual environment' can be done only by entering one command and a name.

This script not just creates a 'virtual environment' for you , it also checks if you have python3 and pip3 installed on
your system. So if your system doesn't have python installed for you, this script will install the python leatest version among
pip for you.

This script only works for linux, I will put the windows version of this script soon. :)
